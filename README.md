# License-Plate-Recognition
The project was developed for automating incoming and outgoing traffic on IIT Roorkee (Indian Institute of Technology) Security Gates. The system takes in a video, filters frames then finds if there is an Indian license plate. Then using character recognition tries to predict the license plate number. Further the system connects to a server to get the status of this vehicle and allows automatic entry for employees.
  
The dataset was collected using real world data of car and their license plates of vehicles entering IIT Roorkee. The photos or real images cannot be shared due to privacy/legal concerns by IIT Roorkee over the dataset. If a demo is required feel free to contact me.
